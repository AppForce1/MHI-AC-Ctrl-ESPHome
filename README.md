This project is a simple integration of the amazing work [absalom-muc](https://github.com/absalom-muc) has done with his project [MHI-AC-Ctrl](https://github.com/absalom-muc/MHI-AC-Ctrl).
\
It's supposed to simplify the Home Assistant setup, while giving you OTA, auto-discovery and other features, with almost zero effort, and no MQTT needed, powered by [https://esphome.io/](ESPHome).
\
MHI-AC-Ctrl-core.\* files were forked directly, with no modification, whereas you WiFi credentials should go into the \*.yaml file, and mhi_ac_ctrl.h is the core of the integration.
\
Just put all these files in your ESPHome folder, flash once, and you're good to go!
